# Installation
You can install Regolith using several methods, depending on your operating system. This section provides instructions for installing Regolith on Linux, Mac, and Windows systems.

## Winget (Windows)
To install Regolith using Winget, open a command prompt or terminal window and enter the following command:
```text
winget install Bedrock-OSS.regolith
```
This command searches the Winget repository for the `Bedrock-OSS.regolith` package and installs it on your system. Upon successful installation, a confirmation message will appear.

To update Regolith in the future, run the following command:
```text
winget upgrade Bedrock-OSS.regolith
```

This checks for available updates to the Regolith package and installs them if found.


```{warning}
Not all Windows computers have Winget pre-installed. If Winget is unavailable on your system, you can install Regolith using the MSI file provided on GitHub (see the next section for instructions).
```

## MSI File (Windows)

You can also install Regolith using the MSI file available on its [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/regolith/releases/latest).

The script will check for available updates to Regolith and install them.
